# üçä EasyPeelSecu

Hello! Welcome to **EasyPeelSecu**, a one-man project dedicated to user-friendly security libraries.  
I started **EasyPeelSecu** with a vision to make the security problems faced by budding projects easily solvable at a junior level. The goal is to transform the perception that security is burdensome and complex into something as approachable and comprehensible as peeling a citrus fruit. I am here to aid you in shifting your mindset from fearing security issues to resolving them with ease.

## Coming Soon

I am currently working on a range of libraries designed to simplify the resolution of various security issues that a project in its early stages could encounter. These libraries will be open-source and free for anyone to use, enhance, and contribute to. Stay tuned for the upcoming release!

## Get Involved

While currently, **EasyPeelSecu** is a solo endeavor, I'm always open to collaboration and contribution from anyone interested in making security more accessible. If you're interested in getting involved, please get in touch with me via the contact information below.
